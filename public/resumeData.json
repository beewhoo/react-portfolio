    "bio":"Hi, I'm Bibek, an enthusiastic web developer with an interest in UX/UI design. After spending 7+ years in the commercial side of websites & apps, I decided to trust my instinct and pursue a career in development. My passion for design and development now has evolved into a brand-new career and an exciting adventure. In during this learning journey, I have proved myself to be a committed learner. The ability to constantly be learning and developing new skills is an important factor in my passion. P.S. I love almost anything under the sun, apart from Real Madrid and slow wifi.",
